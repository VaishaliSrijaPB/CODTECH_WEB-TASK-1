 ## OVERVIEW OF THIS PROJECT
 ### PROJECT NAME: RECIPE ORGANIZER APP USING HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT

 ## OBJECTIVE
 The objective of creating a recipe organization app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is to provide a user-friendly platform where users can:

1. **Store** and **organize** their favorite recipes in a centralized location.
2. **Add** new recipes with details such as ingredients, cooking instructions, and images.
3. **Retrieve** and **view** recipes easily with a simple and intuitive interface.
4. **Edit** and **update** existing recipes as needed.
5. **Delete** recipes that are no longer needed or wanted.
6. **Search** for recipes based on ingredients, cuisine, cooking time, or other criteria.
7. **Share** recipes with friends or on social media platforms.
8. **Save** recipes for offline viewing.

The app aims to simplify the process of managing recipes and helps users to plan their meals more efficiently. It can also serve as a personal cookbook that is accessible from any device with a web browser. The use of web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ensures that the app is cross-platform and does not require any special software to run, other than a web browser.
